# security-decision-trees
This is the companion repo to my blog post on [Creating Security Decision Trees with Graphviz](https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/security-decision-trees-with-graphviz/), based on Chapter 2: Decision Trees â€” Making Attacker Math Work for You in [the Security Chaos Engineering e-book](https://www.verica.io/sce-book/).

There are [.dot files](/branch-dot-files) and their [output graphs](/branch-images) as a reference for each branch of the example tree.

There is also the .dot file and graph image for the [completed example tree](/full-tree).
